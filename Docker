              ========================

* Communication of Docker: DOCKER CLIENT <=> DOCKER SERVER
* Docker server use linux operating system in his Virtual Machine

DOCKER ECOSYSTEM
* When we say Docker that means we are talking 
about the entire ecosystem of Docker products.
===============================================
=> Docker Client
=> Docker Server
=> Docker Machine
=> Docker Hub
=> Docker Compose

*** docker run actually do two things 1. Create docker container & 2. docker start
=> Means: docker run (create docker container + docker start)

# Check Docker Version
=> Run: docker -v
   Run: docker version

# For creating a docker image
=> Run: docker build -t (image_name)
   Run: docker build -t (image_name) .

# For having input in the file's (Create and Run Container)
=> Run: docker run -t -i (image_name)

# Check files or resources of Docker Images
=> Run: docker run (image_name) ls


# Run Container shell
=> Run: docker run (image_name) sh

# Check created Docker Container Id's
=> Run: docker ps

# Check all executed docker container
=> Run: docker ps --all

# Stop running docker container
=> Run: docker stop (container_id) 


# Create docker container from docker Image
=> Run: docker create (image_name)
Now Run this container: Run: docker start -a (container_hash_string) 
Note: '-a' display the output of your container
